# Swin-Transformer-Semantic-Segmentation-Without-mmsegmentation
The code is all from the official implementation, and only some processing is done to make it easy to use.

Official implementation:https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Swin-Transformer-Semantic-Segmentation.

## Usage

Please refer to demo.py, you can easily create a model and add it to other models.



The demo **should not be able to run directly**, because this is the swin-transformer code separated from my model. There may be some dependencies that have not been deleted, but the basic usage has been reflected. You can refer to the usage in the demo and use the model in your code.
